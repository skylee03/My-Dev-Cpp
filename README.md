## Alternatives
*(Other active forks of Dev-C++)*

### [Banzhusoft Dev-C++](https://github.com/banzhusoft/devcpp-cn)

### [Embarcadero Dev-C++](https://github.com/Embarcadero/Dev-Cpp) (recommended)

I have just noticed that Embarcadero is also maintaining a fork of Dev-C++. Given their unparalleled professionalism, I decided to regard the Embarcadero Dev-C++ as the orthodox successor of Bloodshed Dev-C++ and Orwell Dev-C++.

I might keep on maintaining this repository for fun, but since I am now at grade 12 and is busy with my schoolwork, this repository might not get frequent maintaince. Thus the utilization of My Dev-C++ is no longer recommended.

If you are expecting to have a more reliable programming enviroment, the Embarcadero Dev-C++ is a better choice.
