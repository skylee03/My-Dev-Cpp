  cause of many errors (although it should be fixed by now), we are giving the
  user the option to disable this feature.
* New option in Editor Options (code-completion): Use code-completion cache.
  Well, it adds caching to code-completion. Depending on the cache size,
  the program may take a bit longer to start-up, but provides very fast
  code-completion and the user has all the commands (belonging to the files
  he added in the cache) at his fingertips. If, for example, the user adds
  "windows.h", he gets all the WinAPI! If he adds "wx/wx.h", he gets all of
  wxWindows! You get the picture...
* Removed "Only show classes from current file" option in class browser settings.
  It used to be a checkbox, allowing only two states (on or off), but there is
  a third relevant option now: "Project classes" so it didn't fit the purpose...
  The user can define this in the class browser's context menu under "View mode".
* Fixed the dreaded "Clock skew detected" compiler warning!
* Fixed many class browser bugs, including some that had to do with class folders.

Version 4.9.5.2
* Added new option in class-browser: Use colors
  (available when right-clicking the class-browser
  and selecting "View mode").
* Dev-C++ now traps access violation of your programs (and of itself too ;)

Version 4.9.5.1
* Implemented the "File/Export/Project to HTML" function.
* Added "Tip of the day" system.
* When running a source file in explorer, don't spawn new instance.
  Instead open the file in an already launched Dev-C++.
* Class-parser speed-up (50% to 85% improvement timed!!!)
* Many code-completion updates. Now takes into account context,
  class inheritance and visibility (shows items only from files
  #included directly or indirectly)!
